AniMove algorithms for QGIS
---------------------------

QGIS provides a processing environment that can be used to call native and third
party algorithms, making your spatial analysis tasks more productive and easy to
accomplish.

AniMove plugin implements, as a processing submodule, kernel analyses with the
following algs:

* **href**: the *reference* bandwidth is used in the estimation.
* **LSCV (The Least Square Cross Validation)**: the *LSCV* bandwidth is used in
  the estimation.
* **Scott's Rule of Thumb**: the Scott's rule of thumb is used for bandwidth
  estimation.
* **Silverman's Rule of Thumb**: the Silverman's rule of thumb is used for
  bandwidth estimation.
* kernel with adjusted *h*

Utilization distribution and contour lines are produced, and area of the contour
polygons are calculated.

Additionally, restricted Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP) are implemented, as:

* MCP calculation of the smallest convex polygon enclosing all the relocations
  of the animal, excluding an user-selected percentage of locations furthest
  from a centre.

**NOTE**: some of the bandwidth methods are only available with *scipy* 0.11
(custom bandwidth value) and *statsmodels* 0.5 (LSCV, maximum-likelihood
cross-validation).

**NOTE**: at least *scipy* 0.10 **and** the *gdal_contour* command must be
installed in order to have the kernel density algorithm available.
